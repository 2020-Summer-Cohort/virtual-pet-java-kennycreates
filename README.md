# A Real Diamond Dog


After waking from a 9 year coma and escaping the assassination attempts of Cipher. You find yourself on the hunt
for revenge. You're a legend in the eyes of those who live on the battlefield. That's why you have to handle
this mission yourself. Put those 9 years behind you and return as Big Boss.

You've been tasked with rescuing some prisoners from a Soviet occupied Afghanistan village. That and taking out 
Soviet comms. While on mission you come a cross a tough little pup and extract him back to mother base...
The Outer Heaven you've vowed to resurrect. I suspect you discovered a real diamond in the rough. With a little polish
I'd say we've got a true Diamond Dog on our hands. DD, is his name. With the help of Ocelot you can develop DD
into a true champion of the battlefield.

#  DD Virtual App

Keep your Diamond Dog aka DD healthy. Make sure he stays fed and rested. Spend time with DD to bond with him,
that bond is essential when you're out on missions. The more you take him out on missions the smarter he gets
and the tighter the bond you and DD share. Be sure not to over work DD though... He's a tough dog, but every
dog needs rest and replenishing.  

# What's inside

User entry Virtual Pet that responds to your choices. You can exit the app at any time by pressing 9. Follow
